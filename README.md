# 📱 Project: Bharat Yojna 

Despite	the	existence		of	various government		schemes	catering	to
diverse	needs,		people	in	India		face challenges	in	availing	themselves	of the	benefits	of	these	schemes	due		to
inadequate	information	dissemination and	the	inadequacy	of		centralized
records.
<br>
## 📜App Description
* In order to solve this problem we have developed an android application
“BharaYojna” that caters to the demands
of the public by providing them with the exact government schemes for which they
are eligible.
 
* The eligibility is decided by the
various parameters we take like age, occupation, gender etc. of the
person.

* This way the person would not miss out an important scheme that he might get benefitted from.

* It also provides a complete scheme list, the user can search among them for a specific scheme and can get the details out for it.

 
###  Salient features - Chat bot
There is a chatbot in the application that would assist the users in queries related to the schemes by the government.
